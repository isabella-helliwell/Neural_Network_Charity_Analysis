## 3. Coding summary
### 3.1 Deliverable 1
<ins>Preprocessing the data obtained from 'charity_data.csv'</ins>
1. Import the dependencies, and read in the dataset as a DataFrame
2. Clean the data set
3. Check the unique values
4. Decide on which columns to use for binning
5. Plot a density plot to determine the limit for the rare occurances & adjust the values to replace in the appropiate Column
6. Generate a categorical variable list
7. Create a OneHotEncoder instance
8. Merge the OneHotEncoder features and drop the originals
9. Split the preprocessed data into features and target arrays
10. Split the data into a training and testing dataset
11. Create a StandarScaler instance
